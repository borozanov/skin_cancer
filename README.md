# Skin Cancer Detector

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and create a `data/` folder to hold the dataset of skin images.  
```text
git clone https://github.com/borozanov/skin_cancer.git
mkdir data; cd data
```
2. Create folders to hold the training, validation, and test images.
```text
mkdir train; mkdir valid; mkdir test
```
3. Download and unzip the [training data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/train.zip) (5.3 GB).

4. Download and unzip the [validation data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/valid.zip) (824.5 MB).

5. Download and unzip the [test data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/test.zip) (5.1 GB).

6. Place the training, validation, and test images in the `data/` folder, at `data/train/`, `data/valid/`, and `data/test/`, respectively.  Each folder should contain three sub-folders (`melanoma/`, `nevus/`, `seborrheic_keratosis/`), each containing representative images from one of the three image classes.
